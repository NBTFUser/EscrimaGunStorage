<p>I dont know much about this gun so I got daniel to right this</p>
<p></p>
<p>Used in Delivery Driver, Medic, Protection Service, Infantry Soldier, Goverment Official, Military Officer</p>
<p></p>
<p>"A small yet underestimated weapon, thereâ€™s good reason for the USP to be present in most teams that skirt around on the edge of violence. Featuring a restrictive magazine size and a low amount of damage, the USP is certainly not a weapon designed to blow through a heavy crowd.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Concealed correctly, this weapon has lethal power in engagements. Hidden from sight until the last moment, the USP is the perfect tool for any aspiring or professional assassin. The USP aims to play a role when an enemy is weak, or distracted, or in any way not at their strongest. Hitting quick, hard, and violently before slipping away just out of sight, the USP is ideal for quickly dealing with a singular threat. Holding or even having access to a USP can distinctly change the tone of a plan, from a faithless menial onslaught to a tactical, snide offensive which will effectively extinguish the flame of life from an enemy. Warranty void if used to kill."</p>
